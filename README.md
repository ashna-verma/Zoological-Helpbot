During jungle safaris, there are a lot of disturbances in the surrounding environment which might hamper the animal locating ability of the wildlife explorers or safari guides. The aim here is to identify and locate various animals in an open environment consisting of multiple sources of noise.The noises would include wind sound which is common in open grasslands, bird chirps, vehicular noise, unwanted animal noises.so we are denoising the signal acquiring effective noise reduction using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) filters there by classifying the sounds obtaining the voice information and analysing it.

- The framework can filter out noises in a forest and distinguish between multiple animal species sounds.
- Deep learning models like Relu, CNN and Digital Signal Processing concepts like Convolution and Mel spectrogram analysis were used.
